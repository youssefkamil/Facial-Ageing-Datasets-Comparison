# Facial-Ageing-Datasets-Comparison
Facial Ageing Datasets Comparison Report

Problem Description:
- Facial Aging problem is a problem of predicting the age of a person 
based on the images of their face. 
- The goal of this report is to explore all the datasets available for the facial 
aging problem and to find the best dataset to use for the analysis.
- The most essential "metrics" to choose the best dataset are 
(Ages Distribution, Total Number Of Samples, Gender Distribution, 
Usage constrains, Capturing state and availability).
- I have used python and power BI to preprocess and analyze the Datasets.
- I have used the dataset's Metadata to analyze the dataset, some of them 
needed to be cleaned by removing missing data or removing the outliers.
- An interactive PowerBi file is attached with the mail.
